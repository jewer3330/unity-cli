## Summary

<!-- GUIDE: 1-3 bullet points. Each bullet = one sentence. Include both WHAT changed and WHY. -->

- {what changed and why}

## Changes

<!-- GUIDE: List changes grouped by file or module. Each bullet must reference a specific file/module name. -->

- `{file or module}`: {what changed}

## Testing

<!-- GUIDE: Provide reproducible steps. Include exact commands, expected output, or manual verification steps. "Tested" alone is NOT acceptable. -->

- [ ] `{command}` — {expected result}

## Closing Issues

<!-- GUIDE: Issues to auto-close when this change is released to main.
     Use "Closes #N" syntax (one per line). Write "None" if no issues to close.
     SPEC issues must stay in Related Issues / Links and must never appear here.
     Any issue listed only in Related Issues / Links is treated as reference-only. -->

- Closes #{issue number}

## Related Issues / Links

<!-- GUIDE: Use #number or full URL. Write "None" if no related issues.
     SPEC issues belong here, not in Closing Issues. -->

- {#issue or URL or "None"}
