# Unity C# Reference

Browse Unity Technologies' official UnityCsReference C# source as a read-only local cache. This skill is the sibling of `unity-csharp-navigate` (project sources) and `unity-csharp-edit` (writes). Hand off as soon as the request implies project-level reading or a write.

## Use When

- The user asks about the exact signature, attributes, or behavior of a Unity API such as `UnityEngine.Animator.Play` or `UnityEditor.AssetDatabase.Refresh`.
- The user wants to read the internal implementation of a Unity type to predict performance characteristics or side effects.
- The user compares API differences between Unity versions (LTS vs Tech release branches).
- The user wants to validate an LLM-suggested Unity script against the canonical Unity source.

## Do Not Use When

- The user wants to read project-local scripts; use `unity-csharp-navigate`.
- The user wants to write or refactor C# code; use `unity-csharp-edit`.
- The user wants Unity scene state, packages, or assets; use the matching scene, asset, or editor skill family.

## Preferred Flow

1. Run the runtime checklist in [runtime-checklist.md](references/runtime-checklist.md) before the first fetch in a new environment.
2. Populate the cache for the project's Unity version with `unity-cli reference fetch --accept-license` (one-time per version).
3. Use `unity-cli reference grep` for line-level pattern lookups with optional context, or `unity-cli reference search` for filtered file hits.
4. Open the candidate file with `unity-cli reference view --start-line N --max-lines M` to read the relevant span.
5. Confirm the signature or behavior, then hand off to `unity-csharp-navigate` for project sources or `unity-csharp-edit` for writes.

```bash
unity-cli reference fetch --accept-license
unity-cli reference status --output json
unity-cli reference grep "class Animator " --context 3
unity-cli reference view Runtime/Export/Animation/Animator.bindings.cs --start-line 100 --max-lines 60
unity-cli reference clean --keep 1 --dry-run
```

## Examples

- "Show me how Unity implements `Animator.Play` so I can predict whether it allocates."
- "Compare `UnityWebRequest.Get` between Unity 2022.3 and Unity 6 staging."
- "Confirm the exact signature of `EditorApplication.delayCall` before I wire it into the build pipeline."
