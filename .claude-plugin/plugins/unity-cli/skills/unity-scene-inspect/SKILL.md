description: Inspect Unity scenes without mutating them. Use when the user asks to analyze scene hierarchy, list scenes, find a gameobject by name or component, inspect component values, review object references, or query animator state. Do not use for creating scenes; use `unity-scene-create`. Do not use for editing GameObjects; use `unity-gameobject-edit`.

# Scene Inspect

Inspect scene hierarchy, find objects, and read component data without mutating anything. This is the read-only sibling of `unity-gameobject-edit`.

## Use When

- The user wants to inspect the current scene before making changes.
- The user asks where a GameObject, component, or animator state lives.
- The user wants a hierarchy summary, scene inventory, or reference analysis.

## Do Not Use When

- The task is to create new scenes; use `unity-scene-create`.
- The task is to mutate existing objects; use `unity-gameobject-edit`.
- The user only needs source-code navigation with no scene context; use `unity-csharp-navigate`.

## Preferred Flow

1. Start with `get_scene_info`, `list_scenes`, or `get_hierarchy` to scope the work.
2. Locate candidates with `find_gameobject` or `find_by_component`.
3. Inspect targets with `get_gameobject_details`, `get_component_values`, or animator queries.
4. Use `analyze_scene_contents` with `includeInactive` for broad audits.

```bash
unity-cli raw get_hierarchy --json '{"nameOnly":true}'
unity-cli raw find_gameobject --json '{"name":"Player"}'
unity-cli raw get_component_values --json '{"gameObjectName":"Player","componentType":"Transform"}'
unity-cli raw analyze_scene_contents --json '{"includeInactive":true}'
```

## Examples

- "Show the current scene hierarchy and find the player camera."
- "Inspect the `Transform` values on `Player`."
- "Tell me which animator state the character is in right now."
