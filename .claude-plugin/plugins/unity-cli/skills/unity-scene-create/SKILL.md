Do not use for editing existing GameObjects in place; use `unity-gameobject-edit`. Do not use inside prefab edit mode; use `unity-prefab-workflow` instead.

# Scene Bootstrap

Create scenes, add starter GameObjects, and attach initial components via `unity-cli`. This skill owns greenfield scene authoring; it hands off to `unity-gameobject-edit` or `unity-prefab-workflow` once objects already exist.

## Use When

- The user wants to create a brand-new scene from scratch.
- The user asks to add initial GameObjects and components while bootstrapping a scene.
- The user needs help loading, saving, or organising a fresh scene authoring workflow.

## Do Not Use When

- The request mainly mutates existing objects in an already-prepared scene; use `unity-gameobject-edit`.
- The work happens inside prefab edit mode; use `unity-prefab-workflow`.
- The user only wants to read or analyse a scene; use `unity-scene-inspect`.

## Preferred Flow

1. Create or load a scene with `scene create` or `raw load_scene`.
2. Create GameObjects (optionally with a primitive type and `parentPath`).
3. Attach components via `add_component`.
4. Persist with `save_scene` after the bulk authoring is complete.

```bash
unity-cli scene create MainMenu --path Assets/Scenes/
unity-cli raw create_gameobject --json '{"name":"Player","primitiveType":"Cube"}'
unity-cli raw add_component --json '{"gameObjectPath":"/Player","componentType":"Rigidbody"}'
unity-cli raw save_scene --json '{"scenePath":"Assets/Scenes/MainMenu.unity"}'
```

## Examples

- "Create a new gameplay scene and add a `Player` object with physics components."
- "Load `Assets/Scenes/TestScene.unity`, add a camera rig, then save it."
- "Bootstrap a simple empty scene for UI testing."
